# Server-side TodoMVC

## Helping you remember, or select, an MV\* server-side framework.

__INCUBATING PROJECT:__ Currently mostly structure, but templates and couple of first implementations are on the way. I'm leaving this open here, in case anyone cares to join in.

There is without a doubt an almost frightening amount of options for developers to choose from, when selecting a framework for MV\* types of applications.

With the increasing popularity of client-side or JavaScript-based solutions, it's easy to forget the merits of good old server-side solutions. Don't they deserve a place to be cataloged, preserved and provide their legacy to the after-web?

In an answer to this question, and as an answer to a calling - we're doing just that! We have cloned the immensely popular [TodoMVC](http://http://todomvc.com) project, to re-build it in an old and familiar way.

__This time, it's server-side__.

## Getting Involved

The doors are open. Anyone deeply in love with a server-side framework may join-in, clone-out and pull-out with requests to add to the list of example implementations.

We're also very grateful for suggestions, comments and constructive critisism on how to make each solution present the framework it uses in the best possible idiomatic way.

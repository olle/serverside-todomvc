    Server-side TodoMVC - Example Template (v4)

    This is the template that any Server-side TodoMVC example implementation may
    use. It's developed with the goal of being a guide for an implementation. It
    aims to be semantic and beautifully styled out-of-the-box, in order to provide
    the same experience in each Server-side TodoMVC implementation.

    How-to:

    It's easy. Make sure to serve this file from your server, as-is. You should
    now be able to se the full logic-less TodoMVC web application.

    Now your job is to read through this HTML-file and react to each of the `TODO`
    annotations. It should be pretty straight forward.

    Throughout the HTML-code there are `${variable}` placeholders. These are not
    intended to be exact variables for interpolation or templating, but rather
    hints at what type of information that should be output. Feel free to mess
    around and modify anything to better suite your implementation. Also URLs will
    need to be adapted.

    And remember - no JavaScript!

    Good luck and happy hacking!

  Server-side TodoMVC - Example Template (v2)

  This is the template that any Server-side TodoMVC example implementation may
  use. It's developed with the goal of being a guide for an implementation. It
  aims to be semantic and beautifully styled out-of-the-box, in order to provide
  the same experience in each Server-side TodoMVC implementation.

  How-to:

  It's easy. Make sure to serve this file from your server, as-is. You should
  now be able to se the full logic-less TodoMVC web application.

  Now your job is to read through this HTML-file and react to each of the `TODO`
  annotations. It should be pretty straight forward.

  Throughout the HTML-code there are `${variable}` placeholders. These are not
  intended to be exact variables for interpolation or templating, but rather
  hints at what type of information that should be output. Feel free to mess
  around and modify anything to better suite your implementation. Also URLs will
  need to be adapted.

  And remember - no JavaScript.

  Good luck and happy hacking!

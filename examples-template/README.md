Example HTML Template
=====================

This is the plain HTML-only template-kit that we provide for any example
implementation. It's a custom made asset, but was previously derived from the
[TodoMVC](http://http://todomvc.com) project template.

## Getting started

For any example implementation, it should be a simple matter of copying the 
assets and the `index.html` page into the new example implementation. Sometimes
you might have to restructure the placement or linking of resources, for example
images or CSS files.

## Request & Response Compatibility

All the features of the TodoMVC application are normalized for a completely
server-side based implementation to work. This means we have proper HTML forms,
links that go complete GET-requests with parameters, and no Ajax or dynamic
browser features are required in the baseline.

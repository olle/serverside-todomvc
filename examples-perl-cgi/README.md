Server-Side TodoMVC - Perl/CGI
==============================

A classic returns. This implementation example provides a custom configured
[Apache HTTP Server], with Server-Side Includes ([SSI]) and the Common Gateway
Interface ([CGI]) enabled. This was one of the first ever ways to build _dynamic
web pages_ using [Perl] as a programming language.

The `Makefile` provides an easy way to get started, building and starting the
custom configured web server.

To quickly start and see the log output of the web server and scripts, simply
run the target in the _foreground_ using:

```
make fg
```

Happy coding!
